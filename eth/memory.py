"""
This is my implementation of the evm memory.

The memory is a volatile read-write byte-addressable space. It is mainly used
to store data during execution, mostly for passing arguments to internal
functions. Given this is volatile area, every message call starts with a
cleared memory. All locations are initially defined as zero. As calldata,
 memory can be addressed at byte level, but can only read 32-byte words
 at a time.

Memory is expanding when we write to to a word in it that was not previously
used. Additionally to the cost of the write itself, there is a cost to this
expansion, which increases linearly for the first 724 bytes and quadratically
after that.

The EVM provides three opcodes to interact with the memory area:

    MLOAD loads a word from memory into the stack.
    MSTORE saves a word to memory.
    MSTORE8 saves a byte to memory.

There is another key thing we need to know about memory. Solidity always stores
a free memory pointer at position 0x40, i.e. a reference to the first unused
word in memory. Thatâ€™s why we load this word to operate with inline assembly.
Since the initial 64 bytes of memory are reserved for the EVM, this is how we
can ensure that we are not overwriting memory that is used internally by
Solidity.
